# Mini Git

Mini Git is a simple, lightweight version control system inspired by Git, written in C++. This project is designed to help you learn how a version control system works by implementing basic features such as initializing a repository, tracking files, committing changes, viewing logs, and checking out previous commits.

## Features

- **Initialize a repository**: Create a new Mini Git repository in your project directory.
- **Add files to track**: Add files to the repository so that changes can be tracked.
- **Commit changes**: Save changes to files with a commit message.
- **View commit log**: Display a list of all commits with messages and timestamps.
- **Checkout commits**: Restore files from a previous commit.

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler**: A C++11 compatible compiler (e.g., `g++` 6.0 or later).
- **Operating System**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS (with minor adjustments for filesystem handling).
